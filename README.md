  ## Usage 
  Follow these instructions to use the application properly:
  Open a code editor (like `VS Code`), and make sure the project `Textn Tech` is the directory that is currently pulled up.  Using the command line, type `npm install` to install all of the necessary dependencies for the project.  Create an env file with the database name, database user (your username for `mysql`), as well as the database password, respectively using: DB_Name, DB_USER, and DB_PW.  A whole example of the `DB_USER` would be `DB_USER='root'`.  Afterwards, type `npm run dev` and pull up the web app using `http://localhost:3001` unless set differently.
